# [GA23S2 - Group 04] Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

Note that you should have removed ALL TEMPLATE/INSTRUCTION textes in your submission (like the current sentence), otherwise it hampers the professionality in your documentation.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* `Bullet points` are allowed and strongly encouraged for this report. Try to summarise and list the highlights of your project (rather than give long paragraphs).*

* *Try to create `diagrams` for parts that could greatly benefit from it.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report. Note that they only provide part of the skeleton and your description should be more content-rich. Quick references about markdown by [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)*

## Summary of Individual Contributions

Specific details of individual contribution of each member to the project.

Each team member is responsible for writing **their own subsection**.

A generic summary will not be acceptable and may result in a significant lose of marks.

*[Summarise the contributions made by each member to the project, e.g. code implementation, code design, UI design, report writing, etc.]*

*[Code Implementation. Which features did you implement? Which classes or methods was each member involved in? Provide an approximate proportion in pecentage of the contribution of each member to the whole code implementation, e.g. 30%.]*

*you should ALSO provide links to the specified classes and/or functions*
Note that the core criteria of contribution is based on `code contribution` (the technical developing of the App).

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.*

***1.***

**Parser and Grammar:**

- It's an Android app adapter for displaying house listings. The data displayed in the RecyclerView driven by the data provided in the `houseList`.

**Design Patterns:**

- **Adapter Design Pattern:** The code implements the Adapter design pattern, which is a structural pattern commonly used in Android development for efficiently binding data to UI components. It allows the RecyclerView to work with the data source (`houseList`) and efficiently populate the UI views.(https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseAdapter.java)

**Technical Decisions:**

- **Data Binding:** The code uses data binding to connect the data from the `houseList` to the UI elements in the RecyclerView. This decision helps maintain a clean separation of data and UI components.

- **Random Image Selection:** It uses a random image selection from an array of image resources. This provides a variety of visuals for each house listing, making the app more visually appealing. The use of randomization enhances the user experience.

- **Serializable Data Transfer:** To pass data between activities, the code utilizes the `Serializable` interface. While this method works for small data objects, it may not be the most efficient option for larger datasets or complex data structures.

- **Event Handling:** It sets an `OnClickListener` for each item in the RecyclerView. When a user clicks on a house listing, it starts a new activity, `House_Detail_Page`, and passes data related to the selected house along with the random image resource ID (`imageid`). This event handling allows users to view detailed information about a specific house.

***2.***

**House detail page design:**

- **Nested UI:** House detail page uses nested UI design to make the whole able to be rolled and different elements are able to stay in the same line
- **Class based:** House detail page receives a class called house from other page, this can help us to store and show data
- **Realtime interaction with database** The number of likes is saved in real time to make others users able to see updated likes when they enter the page.

### Data Structures

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*
   * *Objective: used for storing the raw data strings loaded from firebase dabase as we store them linearly there and store the search results after price comparison. Sometimes we need to search in other properties, like districts and sizes rather than price. We also display search results in recycle view, which is achieved by designing a linear adapter. *
  * *Code Locations: defined in [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and [class AnotherClass, lines l1-l2](url); processed using [dataStructureHandlerMethod](url) and ...
  * *Reasons:*
     * *On the front page we don't need to search by price.*
     * *Since firebase database is a linear structure, if we want to read data from there, we need to load data one by one and form a list*
     * For the (part), the data ... (characteristics) ...

2. *AVL Tree *
    * *Objective: used for storing, sorting and search accounts and houses for basic feature.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [Class Account, AccountTree and House, HouseTree]
    * *Reasons:*
        * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for search with a time complexity O(h) ,where h means the height of AVL tree*
        * *We don't need to access the item by index for xxx feature because...*
        * For the (part), the data ... (characteristics) ...

3. ...

<hr>

### Design Patterns
*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

1. *State Pattern*
   * *Objective: Login status of a user, 0 for offline and 1 for online.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class Account](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/Account.java#L11); processed in [Activity Login](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L70-75) and [Activity Main_Page, method logOut](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/Main_Page.java#L271-306)
   * *Reasons:*
      * We want to guarantee that any account can only be logged on one device to avoid interruption of actions.
      * Once logged in, the status becomes 1 and after signing out, it becomes 0 and this account can be logged in elsewhere.
2. *Singleton Pattern*
    * *Objective: Only one instance of AVLTreeFactory is created. Firebase database is also an application of Singleton.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [Class AVLTreeFactory](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AVLTreeFactory.java#13) ; processed in [Activity Login](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L56-58) and [Fragment Home, method applySearch(View v)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L287-289), as well as anywhere we load from and reload to FB database.
    * *Reasons:*
        * We want to guarantee that only one instance is created.
3. *Iterator Pattern*
    * *Objective: Use stack to traverse AVL tree, not by recursion.*
    * *Code Locations: defined in [Class AccountTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountTree.java#L229-285) and [class HouseTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseTree.java#L136-190); processed using [Activity AccountDelete](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountDelete.java#L83) and [Fragment Home, method applySearch(View v)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L295-296)
    * *Reasons:*
        * After deletion of a node in Account Tree, we need to transform it to raw data strings ready to store them back to FB database, so we need to visit all accounts in this AVL tree.
        * When searching for houses, we first construct the AVL tree for houses. If price is not detected by Tokenizer and Parser, then we transform them to a list so that we can search by district and size because this House AVLTree is sorted by prices. 
4. *Observer Pattern*
   * *Objective: Notify and trigger immediate and automatic reloading of houses in Home Fragment.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in FB database; processed in [Fragment Home, Listener addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener(){})](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L342-383)
   * *Reasons:*
       * It belongs to the LoadShowData Feature. Once the content of database in our House dir changes, like someone likes or updates a new house, any user who is linked to the database reference is notified and the method onChanged() is triggered, then the front page of current user is reloaded with a toast message showing.

### Parser

### <u>Grammar(s)</u>
Production Rules:

- `<SearchQuery> ::= <Location> <PriceRange> <Bedrooms>`
- `<Location> ::= "location" ":" <SuburbName>`
- `<PriceRange> ::= "price" ":" <MinimumPrice> "-" <MaximumPrice>`
- `<Bedrooms> ::= "bedrooms" ":" <Number>`
- `<SuburbName> ::= "Suburb" | "Kingston" | "Braddon" | ... (and other valid Suburb names)`
- `<MinimumPrice> ::= <Number>`
- `<MaximumPrice> ::= <Number>`
- `<Number> ::= <digit>+ (representing an integer)`


### <u>Tokenizers and Parsers</u>

Tokenizers and parsers are used in the `TokenParse` class( https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java ) to extract and process information from user input in the context of a real estate app. They play a critical role in interpreting the user's search criteria, including location, price range, and the number of bedrooms.

*Location Extraction*

The `extractLocation` method (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java#L31-150 )tokenizes the input and identifies the location specified by the user. It employs regular expressions to check for the presence of alphabetic characters in the input. If a location is identified, it is assigned to the `location` field of the `TokenParse` class.

Advantages:
- Robust identification of location based on patterns.
- Flexibility to recognize various location names.

*Price Range Extraction*

The `extractMinMaxPrice` method (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java#L159-195 )tokenizes the input to identify the minimum and maximum price values. It handles different input formats, including hyphen-separated ranges and single price values with context. The extracted price range is stored as a list in the `priceRange` field.

Advantages:
- Versatile recognition of price ranges.
- Adjustment of the range for input values greater than 100.

*Bedrooms Extraction*

The `extractBedrooms` method (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParse.java#L197-210) tokenizes the input to identify the number of bedrooms specified by the user. It extracts numeric values representing the number of bedrooms and assigns the result to the `bedrooms` field.

Advantages:
- Accurate identification of the number of bedrooms.

## Implemented Features
*[What features have you implemented? where, how, and why?]* <br>
*List all features you have completed in their separate categories with their featureId. THe features must be one of the basic/custom features, or an approved feature from Voice Four Feature.*

### Basic Features
1. [LogIn]. LogIn page is used in this app, only users with right password can log in (easy)
   * Code: [Class LogIn, methods applyLogin, onCreate](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/LogIn.java#L32) and [relative UML](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_log_in.xml)
   * Description of feature: 500 user data including username and password are saved in firebase, only these users can access our app through LogIn. <br>
   * Description of your implementation: We store user data in firebase and retrieve data to verify if the entered user data is available and let user get to main page if it's correct, toast user doesn't exist otherwise. <br>

2. [DataFiles]. We feed app 500 user data and 2278 houses data with some attributes, data is all saved in firebase. Besides, we save our options data of uploading house in local xml file. Besides, we made a like function to help users to like the house, the like data is linked to house and saved in firebase.(easy)
   * Code to the Data File [google-services.json](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/google-services.json), [addressBook.xml](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/assets/addressBook.xml)
   * Link to the Firebase repo: [Firebase repo](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ga-23s2-a5f8f/database/ga-23s2-a5f8f-default-rtdb/data/~2F)
   * [Class GalleryFragment(upload house function)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/gallery/GalleryFragment.java)
   * [Class House_Detail_Page, method buttonLikes.setOnClickListener (like function)](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/House_Detail_Page.java#L75)

3. [LoadShowData]. We reload our house data from firebase when firebase is updated and backend will upload houses automatically every 30 seconds. Data will be shown if there are any users who uploaded houses or like some houses. Also, we show houses and like information to our users and users are able to see changes if these changes database is updated.(medium)
   * Code to show and update Data.[Class HomeFragment, Method databaseReference1.addValueEventListener](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#L342)
   <br>

4. [Search]. User is able to search according to suburb, price, bedroom number in search bar, we also show some possible results while user is entering to help our users. We use a tokenizer and parser to learn what kinds of houses the user is trying to search in our app. For example, we can enter "Acton 500-600 6 Bedroom" in search bar to find houses with 6 bedrooms which are located in Acton and has price between 500 and 600 dollars per week . (medium)
   * Code:[Class TokenParse](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParseTest.java),[Class HomeFragment, method applySearch](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/ui/home/HomeFragment.java#273)

5. [DataStructure] We use AVL tree data structure to support our app with account and house data.
   * Code:[Class AccountTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountTree.java),[Class HouseTree](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseTree.java)

6. [DesignPattern] We have implemented state, iterator, observer and singleton design patterns as mentioned before in design patterns part.

7. [DataProcess] We use Firebase realtime database (json) and local xml file(stores real addresses in AU for usage in uploading new houses) to retrive data as mentioned above.

8. [Tests] We have some JUnit tests to test our non-UI functions and data structures.
   * Code:[Class HouseTreeTest](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/HouseTreeTest.java),[Class AccountTreeTest](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/AccountTreeTest.java),[Class TokenParseTest](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7630421/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/Forum/app/src/main/java/com/example/forum/TokenParseTest.java)

### Custom Features
Feature Category: Search-related features <br>
1. [Search-Invalid]. If you search some invalid like 'citoken' in search bar and the press search, we can recognize it as 'city'.

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

*[Where are the known errors and bugs? What consequences might they lead to?]*
*List all the known errors and bugs here. If we find bugs/errors that your team does not know of, it shows that your testing is not thorough.*

*Here is an example:*

1. *It will stick some time if your click Like button many times in a short time:*
   - Because it takes some time to store data on firebase, you just can't press it too fast.

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
*[Write a well defined protocol your team can use to handle conflicts. That is, if your group has problems, what is the procedure for reaching consensus or solving a problem?
(If you choose to make this an external document, link to it here)]*

This shall include an agreed procedure for situations including (but not limited to):
- e.g., if a member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines
- e.g., if your group has issues, how will your group reach consensus or solve the problem?
- e.g., if a member gets sick, what is the solution? Alternatively, what is your plan to mitigate the impact of unforeseen incidents for this 6-to-8-week project?

Protocols:

Protocol1: When someone is sick, the task of this person will be arranged to other members.

Protocol2: However, it's not reasonable to be sick for a long time, this person's contribution will be reduced if he failed to catch up with other members after recovery.

Protocol3: Group members must attend all meetings where we write codes and design some essential basis of our project, like the properties of each house, UI layout and parameters passed from an activity of a member to another activity of another member.

Protocol4: If we have some disagreements, we need to have meetings to negotiate. We need to ask for tutors or even the lecturer if we can't handle.

Protocol5: If someone fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines, he must provide enough reasons to defend himself and propose a clear deadline to finish his assigned part.
