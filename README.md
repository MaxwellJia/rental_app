# Instructions
This is one of the teamwork projects I did during my education in Australia. It's to implement a prototype of a rental app like Allhomes. I upload it for more advice. Here, I want to express my appreciation for my teammates' efforts on this project.

Android Studio writes this app. To use this app, you can just download My_Place.apk on your Android phone or use your Android Studio virtual phone.

Hope you have fun with the app.
